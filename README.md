## Why 
Stop feeding your cluster with human blood. Creating controlled chaos forces SRE and developers to increase resiliency and decrease late night phone calls or hours spent in war rooms doing all kinds of damage control.  

There is more to chaos engineering than just randomly shutting down instances.

You take a part of the system,  define its steady state and design an experiment that either should or should not affect the system.  Release the kraken and observe the results.

This creates a set of controlled experiments that can be scheduled to run randomly, in coordination with updates or perhaps on a regular basis.

## How
           
Define system steady state

Form a hypothesis 

Create the chaos engine to simulate the experiment

Create a rollback strategy and/or abort procedure

Deploy 

Observe the result 

Schedule 











The monkey stack
A well designed chaos ecosystem could include more monkeys than just the one that breaks instances.  Netflix had a (now retired) set of tools called Simian Army. The basic ideas of the simian army are still highly relevant 

Janitor monkey 

A robot that will ruthlessly clean up unused resources  

Conformity monkey 

This robot will tear down any stack/resource that does not adhere to preset architectural rules, for example a cluster that has its admin interface exposed to the internet.  

Security Monkey 

Whitehat pentest your own systems 

Latency monkey 

One of the trickier issues to identify is often when network connectivity starts behaving in an unexpected way. This would be a way of identifying how a system behaves during 

Customer induced retry storm 
Cascading failures 
Accidental complexity
And could be a valuable tool to identify business and application logic mismatch 

There are many more parts of the stack. Chaos engineering as a field is growing.
